# **OrigamiKings Robotics Mod**

**The download is on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/origamikings-robotics-armor-mod)**

This mod is just for adding robot armor. The robot armor is the same as diamond armor. 

 **If you would like to help code make a pull request or issue on my [Github page](https://github.com/OrigamiKing3612/OrigamiKings-Robotics-Mod). If you can please help. Please do not make any Armor but you can suggest new ones in [issues](https://github.com/OrigamiKing3612/OrigamiKings-Robotics-Mod/issues).**

## Addons
